# Goods-Expanded
A Victoria 3 mod focused on expanding the economic aspect of the game


Mod introduces additional goods with its own mechanics and alters some of the base game mechanics and goods. It also adds new obsessions for cultures.

Dairy
Another food type added to the game, is consumed by most pops. You can choose whether you want your livestock ranches to kill animals for meat, or milk them for dairy.

Beer
Produced by Food Industries together with alcohol, wood+grain-> beer

Housing System
There are three tiers of houses - tenants for the workers, apartments for the middle class and luxury estates for the rich. You can build residential areas in every province which provides housing for your pops (and uses lots of materials). Building has 6 diffirent production methods for deciding the type of housing you want, sewerage, type of heating, electricity and ownership.

Confectionery Industry
Adds another need for your pops - Treats. You can fufill it by providing them with Sweets, you can alter the production by adding Fruits, Dyes etc, upgrade the automation and later in the game produce soft drinks like Coca-Cola. More treats produced in this industry planned for the future (Chocolate for sure).

Updated Obsessions
Germans and czechs now love beer, russians are indulged in spirits, indians prefer dairy products and americans are loving everything with sugar in it, more of it on the way (if you have ideas let me know!)

Sugar beets
Historically sugar beets were introduced to europe in the early 19 century by the Napoleon, but the game doesn't include that and your only option to produce sugar on farms is through fruits. Now your rye farms might produce sugar out of sugar beets, an alternative to the sugar cane.

Carpets
Textile Industry is able to produce luxury carpets using silk

Plans for the future:
Chocolate industry cocoa + sugar -> chocolate (more chocolate can be made by adding milk!)
Jewelry
Copper
